# Distributed Datastructures

Code for a talk about DDS and Message Patterns

**WARNING:** This is a bunch of code put together as a tool for demonstration purposes. Some parts are weird in order to illustrate concepts (I wouldn't really use pub/sub for ring coordination), other parts lack any semblance of safety features (using method names as service commands is extraordinarily unsafe), while still other parts aren't even implemented correctly.

TL;DR: This is a teaching tool. *Caveat emptor*.
